	+ Good

+ create good sort (HashSort)

+ prepare hardware testing environments: 2 laptops, 2 computers

+ prepare software testing environments: Java & C++

+ create spreadsheet for data display

+ modify C++ algorithms to use random ints to Integer.MAX_VALUE
	+ write RandomArray.java
	+ copy for every C++ program
	+ modify every C++ program to use random_numbers.txt

- perform tests (4 computers * 2 languages * 5 sizes * 6+2 sorts): 320 tests D:
	- 4*2*5*6 = 240 base tests (IS,SS,MS,QS)
	- 4*5*2 = 40 stretch tests (GS,BS)
	- 280 total tests D:

- document test results in spreadsheet
	- Insertion
	- Selection
	+ Merge
	+ Quick
	- Hash

- write report first draft
	- describe hypotheses/goals
	- describe testing environments
	- include summary graphs
	- write analysis and conclusions
