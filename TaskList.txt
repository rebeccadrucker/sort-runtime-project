+ demo for Kruse

- finish optimizing algorithms
	- delete output
	- globalize variables
	- shorten variable names

- edit algorithms to include runtime output

- write bad sort

- create good sort

- prepare hardware testing environments: 2 laptops, 2 computers

- prepare software testing environments: Java & C++

- create spreadsheet for data display

- perform tests (4 computers * 2 languages * 5 sizes * 6+2 sorts): 320 tests D:
	- 4*2*5*6 = 240 base tests (IS,SS,MS,QS)
	- 4*5*2 = 40 stretch tests (GS,BS)
	- 280 total tests D:

- document test results in spreadsheet

- write report first draft
	- describe hypotheses/goals
	- describe testing environments
	- include summary graphs
	- write analysis and conclusions
